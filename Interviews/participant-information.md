You are being invited to take part in the above research study. To help you decide whether you
would like to take part or not, it is important that you understand why the research is being
done and what it will involve. Please read the information below carefully and ask questions if
anything is not clear or you would like more information before you decide to take part in this
research. You may like to discuss it with others but it is up to you to decide whether or not to
take part. If you are happy to participate you will be asked to sign a consent form.


**What is the research about?**
In the context of Scribe, a tool to support editors to create new articles, we want to understand
how editors are currently finding references, what challenges are and how they could be
supported to overcome those challenges. I am a PhD researcher at the University of
Southampton, collaborating with Hady Elsahar in this project as part of [Scribe](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Frimelle_and_Hadyelsahar/Scribe:_Supporting_Under-resourced_Wikipedia_Editors_in_Creating_New_Articles).


**Why have I been asked to participate?**
We are looking for editors of any language Wikipedia, that have experience in creating or
extending articles. This will help us understand the current workflow of editors. 


**What will happen to me if I take part?**
We will ask you a set of questions about your editing. We will encourage you to tell us your
experience with editing. If needed, you can look up information online and share the screen
with us. We will record the audio of the conversation and the screen if any work is done on the
computer.

**Are there any benefits in my taking part?**
Our interviews will be the base to create tools to support editors in editing and creating articles
in Wikipedia, with a focus on under-resourced Wikipedias. These insights will be useful longterm to support editors.

**Are there any risks involved?**
There are no risks involved.

**What data will be collected?**
We will collect and transcribe the audio files collected at the interviews with the researchers.
No personal data will be collected or stored. All data will be pseudonymised and only stored on
the password protected computers of the researchers. The consent forms will not be stored
with the interview files. The codes for the pseudonymised files will only be accessible by the
researchers of this study.

**Will my participation be confidential?**
Your participation and the information we collect about you during the course of the research
will be kept strictly confidential.
Only members of the research team and responsible members of the University of
Southampton may be given access to data about you for monitoring purposes and/or to carry
out an audit of the study to ensure that the research is complying with applicable regulations.
Individuals from regulatory authorities (people who check that we are carrying out the study
correctly) may require access to your data. All of these people have a duty to keep your
information, as a research participant, strictly confidential.

**Do I have to take part?**
No, it is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide you want to take
part, you will need to sign a consent form to show you have agreed to take part. 

**What happens if I change my mind?**
You have the right to change your mind and withdraw at any time without giving a reason and
without your participant rights being affected but we would ask you to do so latest two
weeks after the interview takes place. 

**What will happen to the results of the research?**
Your personal details will remain strictly confidential. Research findings made available in any
reports or publications will not include information that can directly identify you without your
specific consent. The results will be published in a research venue, such as a conference or
journal. As this research will give insights of Wikipedia editors’ work with articles, the results
and non-identifiable extracts of the interviews might be stored for a longer time in the form of
transcripts of the audio files. Those files will be pseudonymised by redacting all information
that could indicate the identity of the participant (such as username). If the transcripts are
shared, it will only be with other researchers, and never in full to ensure anonymity.

**Where can I get more information?**
If you have any more questions, contact Lucie <kaffee[@]soton.ac.uk>

**What happens if there is a problem?**
If you have a concern about any aspect of this study, you should speak to the researchers who
will do their best to answer your questions: Lucie <kaffee[@]soton.ac.uk>
